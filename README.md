# 🧠 Machine Learning with Python: foundations

This repository contains materials and exercise codes while following the course **"Machine Learning with Python: foundations"** by Frederick Nwanganga.  
The goal of this repo is to understand the fundamentals of machine learning and practice implementing them using **Python**.

---

## 📌 Course Overview
In this course, I learned:
- What machine learning is and how machines "learn"
- Different types of learning (supervised, unsupervised, etc.)
- How to collect, explore, and prepare data for ML
- Step-by-step implementation of machine learning with Python
- How to build, evaluate, and interpret ML models

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** (data processing)
- **NumPy** (numerical computation)
- **scikit-learn** (machine learning library)
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (data visualization)
- Run on **GitHub Codespaces** or a local environment
